# DiscordBot-FloridaMan

**TechNewsBot** is a Discord bot created for the **BCIT Dev Hub** by Lasekx95, which is a registered club at the British Columbia Institute of Technology.

The purpose of the **TechNewsBot** is to scrape various websites to pull both the title and link and then post( a varying number ) of posts within a server.

**DiscordBot-FloridaMan** is a fork of the original repository to post florida man articles shared on r/FloridaMan. **FloridaMan** is a personal customization to suite my niche interest in Florida men.
